## What's This?

This is a project helps you manage your tons of v2ray subscribe links. You can use it to publish your own link and paste it into your v2ray software to get your nodes instead of pasting tons of links into it

## Gettings Started

This project is developing... So wait for its stable version published so that you can use it. XD

## Scenes to be Used

- When you switched to a new device
- Share your ~~FREE~~ node with your friends and relatives
- More...

## Demo

Demo is not been published yet. It'll be online in the future with some free nodes (\*^▽^\*)
